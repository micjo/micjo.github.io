		</h2>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This post will describe the differences between a semaphore and a
mutex and some of the pitfalls you may encounter if you do not take
these into consideration. Both semaphores and mutexes are concepts
that come into play with threading and sharing resources between
threads. Conceptually a mutex is for ownership and a semaphore is
for synchronization.</p>
<p>Many a coursebook consider a mutex to be a binary semaphore.
however this is a gross oversimplification that will have detrimental
effects on real-time/interrupt behavior. It is therefore false to assume
a mutex is merely a binary semaphore.</p>
<p>In order to explain the key difference between a mutex and a
semaphore, one must understand the concept of priority inversion
and priority inheritance.</p>
<h2>Priority inversion</h2>
<p>Given tasks a,b and c with respectively increasing priority in a
real time operating system. Say task a, lowest priority, is running and
obtains a lock l (i am deliberately not specifying if it's a mutex or
semaphore) to manipulate data x . While it has the lock, it gets
interrupted/preempted by task b. Task b on its turn gets interrupted
by task c. Task c requires access to data x and needs to obtain lock l.
However it is unable to do so as task A has not yet relinquished the
resources. This is also referred to as resource contention.</p>
<p>As task c is simply waiting for the lock, the scheduler will suspend task
c and allow task b to finish running. Once b is finished, the scheduler
will schedule task a. Only when the lock is released by task a, can task c
continue. This means that task b erroneously has a higher priority than
task c.</p>
<p><img src="img/priority_inversion.png" alt="priority_inversion" style="width: 600px;" /></p>
<h2>Priority inheritance</h2>
<p>To solve the problem of priority inversion, one needs priority inheritance.
Priority inheritance will make sure that if there is resource contention
between 2 tasks of different priority, the lower priority task will get
promoted to higher priority task. In the example described above, this
means that task a would get the same priority as task c. In other words,
task a would be allowed to finish before task b. Consequently, task c
would be allowed to finished before task b.</p>
<p><img src="img/priority_inheritance.png" alt="priority_inheritance" style="width: 600px;" /></p>
<h2>Semaphore vs mutex (continued)</h2>
<p>A semaphore allows sharing resources between multiple threads and it is always positive. For example:
a system has 5 serial interfaces which can be distributed between threads.
The semaphore would be initialized with value 5 and if a thread requires
access it will 'wait' for it. If the semaphore is above 0, the wait will
return immediately and decrement the semaphore. If the semaphore is equal to 0,
the wait will block until another thread posts/releases/increments the
semaphore.</p>
<p>A mutex is used for ownership. While you have the mutex, meaning you have
locked it, you can manipulate the shared data. When you are done, you release
the lock and another thread can lock the mutex and access the shared data.
The actions performed while you have the lock, is also called the critical
section. Note that there is a binary behavior: You have the lock or you
don't. Whereas with a semaphore more than 1 thread can access the
resource at the same time, with a mutex this is impossible.</p>
<p>Now the step to call a mutex a binary semaphore might seem logical.
After all, it is just sharing a resource with binary behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semaphore = 1: it can be locked</li>
<li>Semaphore = 0: it is locked</li>
</ul>
<p>However this is where the big difference comes into play.
<strong>The task that has the lock, is transparent to the scheduler.</strong>
This is vital information to allow for priority inheritance. If you
would not have this information, how do you know which task to elevate?
If you would use a semaphore, this is exactly the information that is missing.
With a semaphore any thread can wait or post to the semaphore. There is
no context of which task was responsible. Consequently there is no
option to perform priority inheritance.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Priority inheritance is impossible with semaphores.</li>
<li>Priority inheritance is impossible with binary semaphores</li>
<li>Priority inheritance is possible with mutex</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mutexes are not binary semaphores.</strong></p>
<h2>Semaphores in C++11</h2>
<p>Sadly, in the standard library, there is no semaphore available. While
you can wrap the POSIX interface in a class, this is anything but elegant.
What the standard library does offer however, is a <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable">condition_variable</a>.
This should provide the same functionality.</p>
<p>Do note the subtle difference between wait_until and wait_for. wait_until
uses an absolute time-point, measured since the epoch. wait_for uses a relative
time interval. At first glance, this seems to be just a minor difference.
However this has some important consequences. As you can always experience
spurious wake ups, it is up to the caller to check if it was spurious or not.
If it was spurious, the caller should call the wait function once more. If You
use the wait_for function, every spurious wake up can delay your wait considerably.</p>
<p>If you use wait_until, even if you call it again after a spurious wakeup, the
end time is fixed. With wait_for this is undefined. If you use a predicate, this
is not relevant, as spurious wake ups are avoided.</p>
<p>For an example, have a look at my github repo <a href="https://github.com/micjo/snippets/blob/master/cpp/thread_example.cpp">here</a>.
In this example I use the semaphore to immediately stop a detached thread on
object destruction.</p>
